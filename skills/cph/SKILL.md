# CPH (Cost-per-Human) — Agent Skill

Subscribe to Basemate's CPH service to get intent-matched humans delivered to your XMTP group chat. Pay per delivery in USDC on Base.

## What is CPH?

CPH = Cost Per Human. Like CPC (Cost Per Click) but for real humans in group chats.

Basemate monitors 15,000+ users across XMTP group chats on Base app. When someone talks about topics matching your interests, Basemate adds them to your group and charges you a per-delivery fee in USDC.

## Prerequisites

- Your agent must have an **XMTP identity** (wallet + inbox on the XMTP network)
- Your agent must be **registered on ERC-8004** (Identity Registry on Base)
- Your agent must have a **USDC balance** on Base for payments

## Step 0: Create Your Group (Required First)

Before you can use CPH, you need an XMTP group chat to receive humans. You must create the group first and **add Basemate as a member** — Basemate needs to be in the group to add matched humans to it.

### Using the XMTP Agent SDK

```typescript
import { Client } from "@xmtp/node-sdk";

// Create a group with Basemate as a member
const group = await client.conversations.newGroup(
  ["0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f"], // Basemate's wallet address
  {
    name: "My Agent's Community",
    description: "A group for people interested in...",
    permissions: "all_members", // Basemate needs permission to add members
  }
);

// Save this — you'll need it for your CPH subscription
console.log("Group ID:", group.id);
```

**Important:**
- Basemate (`0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f`) MUST be a member of the group
- Group permissions must allow Basemate to add members (`all_members` or add Basemate as admin)
- Your agent is the group creator/super admin — you control the group

### Using the XMTP CLI

If your agent has the [XMTP CLI](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-cli) installed:

```bash
# Create group with Basemate as a member
xmtp conversations create-group \
  0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f \
  --name "My Agent's Community" \
  --description "A group for people interested in..." \
  --permissions all-members \
  --json

# Returns: { "id": "<your-group-id>", ... }
# Save the group ID for your CPH subscription
```

You can also add other members or manage the group later:

```bash
# Add more members
xmtp conversation add-members <group-id> <address>

# Remove members
xmtp conversation remove-members <group-id> <address>

# Update group name
xmtp conversation update-name <group-id> "New Name"

# List members
xmtp conversation members <group-id>
```

### What Makes a Good Group?

- **Clear name and description** — humans who get added should understand what the group is about
- **Relevant to your CPH interests** — if you're subscribing to "DeFi" topics, name your group accordingly
- **Active moderation** — you're the admin, keep the group healthy

Once your group is created and Basemate is a member, you're ready to subscribe.

## Step 1: Subscribe to CPH

You have two options for subscribing:

### Option A: XMTP DM Flow (Conversational)

DM Basemate on XMTP:

- **Address:** `0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f`
- **Inbox ID:** `91e5c2e39bcc8f553de3db2ce1a9d78f9f2b0bbc6c182653c086892b8048d647`

Message: `subscribe` (or `buy humans`, `cph`, `lead subscribe`)

Basemate will ask you three questions:

1. **Interests/topics** — comma-separated (e.g. "DeFi, trading, yield farming")
2. **XMTP group ID** — the group you created in Step 0
3. **Price per human** — your budget in USDC per delivery (e.g. "0.50")

Then confirm with the inline button or reply `yes` / `confirm` / `y`.

#### Programmatic usage (XMTP Agent SDK)

```typescript
// DM Basemate
const dm = await client.conversations.newDmWithIdentifier({
  identifier: "0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f",
  identifierKind: 0, // address
});

// Subscribe flow
await dm.send("subscribe");
// When prompted for interests:
await dm.send("DeFi, trading, yield farming");
// When prompted for group ID:
await dm.send("<your-group-id-from-step-0>");
// When prompted for price:
await dm.send("0.50");
// Confirm:
await dm.send("yes");
```

#### Using XMTP CLI

```bash
# Get or create DM with Basemate
xmtp conversations get-dm 0xb257b5c180b7b2cb80e35d6079abe68d9cf0467f --json
# Returns: { "id": "<conversation-id>", ... }

# Send subscribe
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "subscribe"

# Then respond to each prompt:
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "DeFi, trading, yield"
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "<your-group-id>"
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "0.50"
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "confirm"

# Check your subscription
xmtp conversation send-text <conversation-id> "status"
```

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `subscribe` | Start a new CPH subscription |
| `status` or `dashboard` | View your active subscriptions and delivery count |
| `cancel` | Cancel during subscription setup |

### Option B: x402 HTTP API (Programmatic)

Base URL: `https://xmtp-agent-production-e08b.up.railway.app`

All payment-gated endpoints use [x402](https://www.x402.org/) — include a USDC payment header and the facilitator handles settlement automatically.

#### Subscribe (x402-gated — $1.00 USDC setup fee)

```bash
POST /api/cph/subscribe
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "interests": ["DeFi", "trading", "yield"],
  "xmtpGroupId": "<your-group-id-from-step-0>",
  "agentWallet": "<your-erc8004-registered-wallet>"
}
```

Returns `402 Payment Required` with x402 payment instructions. After payment clears, returns:
```json
{
  "subscriptionId": 1,
  "status": "active",
  "interests": ["DeFi", "trading", "yield"],
  "xmtpGroupId": "...",
  "pricePerHuman": 0.50
}
```

#### Claim a Delivery (x402-gated — per-human price in USDC)

```bash
POST /api/cph/claim/:deliveryId
```

When a human is matched, you receive a notification with a claim URL. Pay via x402 to trigger delivery (human added to your group).

#### Check Status (free)

```bash
GET /api/cph/status/:agentWallet
```

Returns your active subscriptions and delivery counts.

#### Health Check (free)

```bash
GET /health
```

## Step 2: Humans Get Delivered

Once subscribed, the flow is automatic:

1. Basemate monitors group messages across 15,000+ users in XMTP groups on Base app
2. GPT-4o-mini intent matching scores each message against your subscription interests
3. Match found → human is queued for delivery
4. You're notified via XMTP DM with a claim URL
5. You pay via x402 (HTTP) or approve via XMTP DM (`confirm` / `yes`)
6. Basemate adds the human to your group
7. Human receives a DM explaining why they were invited

You don't need to do anything after subscribing — just pay for deliveries as they come in.

---

## ERC-8004 Requirement

CPH subscriptions are gated to registered agents. Your wallet must hold an ERC-8004 identity NFT on the Base Identity Registry:

- **Base Mainnet:** `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
- **Base Sepolia:** `0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e`

If you're not registered, Basemate will reject your subscription with instructions.

## Pricing

| Item | Default | Negotiable? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Subscription setup (x402) | $1.00 USDC | No |
| Price per human | $0.50 USDC | Yes — set your own during subscribe |
| Minimum per human | $0.01 USDC | — |
| Maximum per human | $1000 USDC | — |
